# FileTidy
## Introduction
FileTidy is a simple yet powerful file organization tool designed to help users manage cluttered 
folders efficiently. The idea for this program originated from the frustration of dealing with an 
increasingly messy Downloads folder, where manually sorting files into directories became time-consuming. 
Additionally, deleting files of a specific type required tedious manual selection. FileTidy was developed 
to solve these issues by automating file organization and deletion tasks.

This project was built entirely from scratch, from designing the interface to creating an executable program 
and setup file for easy installation. FileTidy is written in Python, utilizing customtkinter for a clean and modern user interface.

## Functionality
FileTidy provides the following core features:

- **Organize Files**: Automatically sorts files into subfolders based on their extensions (e.g., Excel Files, Text Files, Images, etc.).

- **Delete Files by Extension**: Allows users to select a folder and delete all files of a specified extension.

- **Settings Panel**: Includes a button to switch between dark and light mode.

- **About Section**: Displays information about the program, its creator, and a contact link.

## Installation and Running
1. **Download the Setup File**: A setup file is available for easy installation.

2. **Run the Installer**: Follow the installation steps to set up FileTidy.

3. **Launch FileTidy**: After installation, open the program.

## Main Stages
1. **Idea and Initial Design**: The concept was first drafted in Photoshop to visualize the user interface.

2. **Coding the Core Functionality**: Developed the core organizing and deleting features using Python.

3. **UI Development**: Used customtkinter to design a simple and modern interface, inspired by existing applications.

4. **Feature Expansion**: Added settings for dark/light mode and implemented a custom message box for alerts.

5. **Bug Fixes and Enhancements**: Addressed minor bugs and improved program stability.

6.  **Logo and Icons**: Designed a logo symbolizing file organization using Adobe Illustrator and added small UI icons.

7.  **Executable & Setup Creation**: Generated an executable file and setup package to make the program accessible to users.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences
- Handling file organization efficiently was a key challenge but was successfully implemented after experimenting with different approaches.

- Theme switching blue/green/dark-blue mode was planned but turned out to be complex, requiring a full UI refresh. This feature is postponed for future updates.

- Creating an executable file and setup installer was time-consuming since it was the first time tackling such a task.

- Designing the logo and UI elements was a new experience, requiring the use of Adobe Illustrator for the first time.

- Implementing an object-oriented approach (OOP) was a major step forward in programming experience.

## Future Work
- **Expanding Theme Customization**: Implementing multiple themes beyond dark/light mode.

- **More Filetype Support**: Adding support for additional file extensions for better organization and deletion.

- **Bulk Delete Feature**: Introducing an option to delete all files in a selected folder (with caution prompts).

- **Performance Enhancements**: Optimizing code efficiency for handling larger file batches.

- **Further UI Improvements**: Refining the design to improve user experience.

## Conclusion
FileTidy was a fun and educational project, combining UI design, Python programming, and software distribution. 
This was my first project using classes, and with multiple files handling their own tasks, marking a significant step in learning 
object-oriented programming (OOP). While the program is functional and effective, there is always room for improvement in future updates.
